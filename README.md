This is a showcase of my work with programming languages and most specifically C++. These files demonstrate my ability to write well-documented and readable code, design functional programs that meet industry standards, and use multiple programming languages to develop secure and efficient code. This project involves creating a program for a grocery store to analyze daily purchase records. The program helps the store understand which items are bought most frequently allowing them to organize their produce section effectively.

Problem Being Solved:
The grocery store needs to rearrange its layout to improve customer experience and potentially increase sales. To do this they need to analyze which items are purchased most frequently throughout the day.

Strengths:
Integrated both C++ and Python for efficient data analysis.
Used maps in C++ for easy storage and retrieval of item frequencies.
Handled missing data file scenario in Python code.

Areas for Enhancement:
Improve error handling to handle unexpected situations better.
Add input validation to ensure user inputs are valid.

Challenges:
Integrating functionalities from two different languages seamlessly.
Designing a user-friendly program to handle various tasks efficiently.

Support Network:
Will utilize online resources for guidance and feedback in the future.

Transferable Skills:
Understanding data structures for efficient data management.
Experience in integrating functionalities across different languages.
Practiced error handling and input validation in real-world scenarios.

Maintainability, Readability, Adaptability:
Used clear variable names and comments for easy understanding.
Modular code design allows for easy maintenance and future enhancements.
Followed industry best practices for code quality and consistency.
